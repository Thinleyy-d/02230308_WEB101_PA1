### Key Components

#### WhatsAppLayout

The main container component that manages the overall layout and state. It handles:

- Mobile/desktop view switching
- Selected chat state
- Responsive layout adjustments

#### Sidebar Components

The sidebar contains the user's profile, search functionality, and list of conversations:

- **SidebarHeader**: Shows the current user's avatar and action buttons
- **SearchInput**: Allows filtering conversations by contact name
- **ChatList**: Renders the list of conversations
- **ChatItem**: Individual conversation preview with last message and timestamp


#### Chat Area Components

The chat area displays the selected conversation:

- **ChatHeader**: Shows recipient info and action buttons
- **MessageList**: Renders the message history
- **MessageBubble**: Individual message with text, timestamp, and status
- **ChatInput**: Input field for typing and sending new messages


### Message Status Implementation

I implemented a visual indicator system for message status (sent, delivered, read) using Lucide React icons:

// From MessageBubble component
const getStatusIcon = () => {
  switch (message.status) {
    case "sent":
      return <Check size={16} className="text-gray-400" />;
    case "delivered":
      return <CheckCheck size={16} className="text-gray-400" />;
    case "read":
      return <CheckCheck size={16} className="text-blue-500" />;
    default:
      return null;
  }
}

## Responsive Design Approach

I implemented a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes:

### Mobile View (< 768px)

- Shows either the sidebar or chat area, not both simultaneously
- Includes a back button in the chat header to return to the conversation list
- Optimized touch targets for mobile interaction


### Tablet/Desktop View (â‰¥ 768px)

- Shows both sidebar and chat area side by side
- Sidebar takes 1/3 of the screen width
- Chat area takes 2/3 of the screen width


I used a custom hook for detecting mobile screens:

// Mobile detection implementation in WhatsAppLayout
useState(() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    const checkIfMobile = () => {
      setIsMobile(window.innerWidth &lt; 768)
    }
    
    // Initial check
    checkIfMobile()
    
    // Add event listener
    window.addEventListener("resize", checkIfMobile)
    
    // Clean up
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("resize", checkIfMobile)
    }
  }
}, [])

## State Management

I used React's useState hook for managing component state:

- **WhatsAppLayout**: Manages selected chat, mobile view state, and sidebar visibility
- **Sidebar**: Manages search query state and filtered chats
- **ChatArea**: Manages messages state and handles sending new messages


For a small to medium-sized application like this, I found that local component state was sufficient without needing to introduce more complex state management libraries.

## Dependencies

I carefully selected the following dependencies:

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-rendered applications
- **React 18**: For building the user interface
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling
- **Lucide React**: For icons (smaller bundle size than alternatives)
- **next-themes**: For dark mode implementation
- **Radix UI**: For accessible UI components like dropdowns and avatars


I chose these dependencies because:

1. They provide a good balance between functionality and bundle size
2. They follow accessibility best practices
3. They integrate well with Next.js
4. They allow for rapid development without sacrificing customization


## Challenges & Solutions

During development, I encountered several challenges:

### Challenge 1: Mobile Responsiveness

Initially, I struggled with the mobile view switching between sidebar and chat area. I solved this by implementing a state-based approach that conditionally renders components based on screen size and user interaction.

### Challenge 2: Message Status Indicators

Implementing the different message status indicators (sent, delivered, read) required careful consideration of the UI. I created a function that returns the appropriate icon based on the message status.

### Challenge 3: Path Aliasing

I initially used path aliases (@/components/*) which caused import issues. I resolved this by switching to relative imports and properly configuring jsconfig.json.

## Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would implement:

1. **Real-time Functionality**: Integrate WebSockets for real-time messaging
2. **Authentication**: Add user login and registration
3. **Media Sharing**: Enable sharing images, videos, and documents
4. **Voice/Video Calls**: Implement WebRTC for calling features
5. **Message Reactions**: Add emoji reactions to messages
6. **End-to-End Encryption**: Implement message encryption for privacy

## Conclusion

This WhatsApp Web clone demonstrates my understanding of modern React development practices, component architecture, and responsive design principles. By focusing on a modular component structure and clean separation of concerns, I've created a maintainable and extensible application that closely mimics the core functionality of WhatsApp Web.

The project showcases my ability to:

- Design and implement a component-based architecture
- Create responsive layouts that work across different devices
- Manage application state effectively
- Implement complex UI patterns like message status indicators
- Write clean, maintainable code with proper documentation
